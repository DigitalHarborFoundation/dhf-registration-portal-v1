## Registration Portal

This is a user-facing registration portal built for the [Digital Harbor Foundation](https://www.digitalharbor.org/) youth and families. This is an intermediary step toward the full registratoin portal and it aims to resolve some painpoints faced by the community and staff.

## Built With

This is built with Next.js with an Airtable backend. Airtable is a tool central to the team's processes and data, and this frontend improves the user experience by auto-toggling waitlists when courses are full. Next.js and Airtable is a powerful combo for building additional functionality on top of Airtable.

This is a work in progress and is meant to be a "step along the way" toward the fully featured version.
