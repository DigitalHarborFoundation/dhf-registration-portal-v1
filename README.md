## Registration Portal

This is a user-facing registration portal built for the [Digital Harbor Foundation](https://www.digitalharbor.org/) youth and families. This is an intermediary step toward the full registratoin portal and it aims to resolve some painpoints faced by the community and staff.

This is a work in progress and is meant to be a "step along the way" toward the fully featured version.

## Built With

This is built with Next.js with an [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) backend. Next.js and Airtable is a powerful combo for building additional functionality on top of Airtable.

### Front End

The frontend is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with TypeScript), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data-fetching.

### Backend

Airtable is a tool central to the team's processes and data, and this frontend improves the user experience by auto-toggling waitlists when courses are full.
